# Web_Navigator

Web_Navigator
This project, Web Navigator, simulates the navigational operations of a web browser such as :

opening a new web page,
navigating back a page and
going forward a page. We will use the Stack class to maintain the history of visited pages with a backPages stack and a nextPages stack.

User input is required to:

enter a new page to be visited,
navigate backward or forward a page, and
to quit the program.
The option to navigate forward or backward is conditional depending on user input and the state of the stacks. We will explain this in more detail in the relevant tasks.
